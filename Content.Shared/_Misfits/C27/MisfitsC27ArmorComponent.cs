// #Misfits Add - Marker placed on every C-27 outer-armor / helmet entity. Presence of this
// component enforces the rule "only C-27 robots may wear this clothing". The inverse direction
// (a C-27 wearing non-C-27 outerwear) is enforced by the `c27` inventory template's tag
// whitelist (`C27Wearable`) defined in Resources/Prototypes/_Misfits/InventoryTemplates/.
// Not networked: the marker + RequiresC27Species field never change at runtime, and the
// equip-gate runs in a shared system so client + server agree without state replication.
